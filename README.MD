# üë¥Rick And Morty Apiüë¶

## About üí°
**Some introductory information:**
- **Pull data** about characters from the *Rick and Morty* multiverse from an <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/">**open source**</a> and save it to your ***PostgreSQL*** database.
- When synchronizing data with an open source, *avatars for characters in ***JPEG*** format* are also **downloaded and saved** in *the folder with your application.*
- **You do not need to do this synchronization manually.** 
It will be executed **automatically** when you **start the application** and **every morning at 8 o'clock.**
- **The endpoints of this API** can give information about ***a random character in json format***, can upload ***a character's avatar by ID***, can give ***character information by ID*** and can give ***a list of all characters supporting sorting, pagination and filtering by various parameters.***
*More about endpoints will be below.*
- The application has **unit tests** (***Testcontainers*** for repository tests, ***MockMvc*** for controller tests)
- *All controllers* have their *own internal documentation* with ***swagger.***
You can read it in **controller classes**, or by clicking on the ***<a href="http://localhost:8080/movie-characters/swagger-ui-docs.html">link</a>*** 
*(the path can be changed in the **application.properties** file).*
